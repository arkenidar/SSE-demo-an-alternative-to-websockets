#inter_page_transfer This project is demoing ServerSentEvents for a system that features sending a string of text 
(you can build your own protocol with it e.g. a JSON-bases protocol)
across pages (identified by proper IDs in URLs).

You can pay me for adaptations, improvements and related consulting.
Remember to respect the liberal MIT licence! (e.g. give due credit).
